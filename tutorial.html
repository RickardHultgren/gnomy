        <h1>Gnomy’s Lantern Quest</h1>
        <h2>The Path of Light</h2>
        <p>
          In a magical land where lush gardens stretch across rolling hills and towering forests, <span class="highlight">Gnomy</span> the gnome embarks on an endless quest for fruit. Though Gnomy does not own any of the gardens, he holds a unique power—the ability to create <span class="highlight">mulch paths</span> between the trees. These paths are not just ordinary trails; they belong to Gnomy alone, marking the way between the groves and orchards where the sweetest fruits grow.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          But Gnomy's task is no simple harvest. To ripen the fruits, Gnomy must first <span class="highlight">pollinate the flowers</span> of each tree. Once pollinated, the fruits will flourish, but they take time—<span class="highlight">one week to ripen</span> to perfection. However, the fruits are delicate and fleeting; if Gnomy doesn't return within <span class="highlight">two weeks</span>, the fruits wither and fall, leaving nothing but lost opportunity. Even more troubling, the paths Gnomy so carefully laid will disappear, dissolving back into the earth, forcing him to start anew.
        </p>
    
        <h2>The Lantern of Light and Resin Ritual</h2>
        <p>
          Navigating the vast gardens is a challenge, for Gnomy cannot see his own mulch paths without the guiding light of his <span class="light">storm lantern</span>. Yet the lantern is a hungry flame, and it cannot burn without fuel. For this, Gnomy relies on the magical properties of the trees themselves.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Each tree holds <span class="resin">resin</span>, a sticky golden sap that Gnomy carefully collects. With ancient gnome magic, he transforms this resin into <span class="resin">amber beads</span>, glowing gems of pure energy. He strings the amber beads along a <span class="highlight">wick</span> that powers his lantern, providing him the light he needs to see his paths and travel between the trees.
        </p>
    
        <h2>The Race Against Time</h2>
        <p>
          As Gnomy works tirelessly to harvest fruits and maintain his paths, time is his greatest enemy. Without constant effort, his paths will fade, and the fruits will spoil. Gnomy’s journey is an endless balance of pollination, harvesting, and resin collection, all while ensuring his <span class="light">storm lantern</span> never dims.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          But Gnomy is resilient, and with every tree pollinated and every fruit gathered, he grows more skilled in his magical craft. Will you join him on this journey? Can you help Gnomy light the way, keep the fruits fresh, and maintain the mulch paths as he collects the bounty of the gardens?
